# Credit Card Fraud Analysis with Power BI

## Overview

The 'Credit Card Fraud Analysis' Power BI dashboard aims to dissect credit card usage data to identify and analyze patterns of fraudulent transactions. By exploring various demographic and account-related attributes, this tool aids financial institutions in understanding the characteristics that correlate with higher instances of fraud.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard comprises multiple visualizations that collectively provide a comprehensive view of fraudulent activity:

- **Total and Defaulted Customers**: Showcases the number of customers considered and the number of those with defaulted accounts.
- **Defaulted Customers by Education**: Analyzes default rates across different educational backgrounds.
- **Defaulted Customers by Sex**: Compares default rates between male and female customers.
- **Defaulted Customers by Age**: Depicts how age influences the likelihood of defaulting.
- **Defaulted Customers by Marital Status**: Illustrates default rates according to marital status.
- **Detailed Demographic Breakdown**: Further breaks down default rates by combining demographic factors such as marital status, education, and sex.
- **Credit Limit Balance Analysis**: Examines how the credit limit balance correlates with default rates, segmented by marital status, education, and sex.

## Key Insights

The visualizations provide several actionable insights:
- Educational background has a noticeable impact on default rates, with certain education levels presenting higher risk.
- Marital status, when correlated with sex, shows differentiated risk profiles.
- Age-related trends suggest specific age groups are more susceptible to defaulting.
- The interaction between credit limit balances and demographic factors offers a nuanced view of potential risk.

## Data Source

The dataset includes diverse attributes such as age, sex, marital status, education, and credit limit balances. The data has been meticulously cleaned and transformed to support the analysis.

## Tools and Techniques
